Welcome to my personal site code!

Here are some of my goals for this site:
    1. Have a creative outlet for myself on the web
    2. Provide a space for me to write and share writing that I like
    3. Experiment with web design and creation, share my ideas and maybe art!

Feel free to explore my code. I appreciate feedback! I am learning just as we all are. 

Have a good day!

Currently, here is how the python functions:
    1. a function input_parse() is defined
    2. for each line of text in the inputted file, input_parse() checks to see if the line starts with # or ##
    3. if the line starts with ##, it stores and returns the line as an element in a list called headers
    4. if the line starts with #, it stores and returns the line as an element in a list called paragraphs
    5. input_parse() is called, and then the lists are seperated into their own variables, which are returned
