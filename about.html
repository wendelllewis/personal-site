        <p>I am a student in Colorado. Learning about the world through asking questions and doing research has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. I am in the process of forming my opinions on the world–I certainly do not know anything. That is why I am here–I want to keep learning. I created this site in order to have a creative outlet–both in designing and programming the site and its functionality, as well as writing. I hope to write articles on things such as art, politics, nature, history, religion, and philosophy. These are big aspirations for me now–I don't feel that I have the knowledge currently to be writing all of this, but the only way to gain that knowledge is by doing.</p>
        <p>I created this site from scratch using html and css, and am currently hosting on neocities, as you can see. I also have a github repo with all of the code that I wrote for this project.</p>
        <p>In the future, I would love to expand my writing and maybe do something like a newsletter? We'll see...</p>
